```html
<section id="banner-container">
            <div id="banner-image"></div>
            <div class="vertical-center-button">
                <input type="button" onclick="location.href='/pages/order.html'" class="shop-button" value="Shop Now" >
            </div>
        </section>
```

issue with not showing grid images inline and was stacking images on top of each other, or iin a single column when added additional div elements, original code below, but showing just 2 img elements for less space.

```html
        <setion class="album_container">
            <h1> Social Celebrations</h1>
            <div class="album_photo_container">
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_01-pexels-any-lane-5727978.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="mom and daughter decorating a sponge cake with chocolate">
                    <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_02-pexels-august-de-richelieu-4262422.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="family of 5 standing and looking down to a srawberry cake placed on the table">
                                </div>
            </div>
        </setion>
```

css code original

```css
.album_container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(6,1fr);
    grid-auto-rows: 100px 300px;
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

.album_photo_container {
    width: 100%;
    Height: 100%;
    position: relative;
}

.album_photo_container .image {
    width: 100%;
    Height: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.album_photo_container .image img {
    width: 100%;
    Height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
```

to fix the issue found out that each image has to be in its own div wrapper and have same class applied.

```html
      <setion class="album_container"> <!--container-->
             <div class="album_photo_container"> <!--gallery_container-->
                <div class="album_item"> <!--gallery_item-->
                    <div class="image"> <!--image-->
                        <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_01-pexels-any-lane-5727978.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="mom and daughter decorating a sponge cake with chocolate" >
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="album_photo_container">
                <div class="album_item">
                    <div class="image">        
                        <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_02-pexels-august-de-richelieu-4262422.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="family of 5 standing and looking down to a srawberry cake placed on the table">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
