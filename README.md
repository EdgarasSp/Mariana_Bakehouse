> ##### [Table of Content](#table-of-contents)

# **4. Testing**

<br>

## **4.1. Bugs and Fixes**

1.  On click function did not work, after some research and troubleshooting identified that I have typed   ``` onclick="href='/pages/order.html' ``` instead of ```onclick="location.href='/pages/order.html' ```

    Corrected code snippet below:

    ```html
    <section id="banner-container">
                <div id="banner-image"></div>
                <div class="vertical-center-button">
                    <input type="button" onclick="location.href='/pages/order.html'" class="shop-button" value="Shop Now" >
                </div>
            </section>
    ```


2. Issue with not showing grid images inline and css was stacking images on top of each other, or in a single column.
    
    Solution was to add additional div elements, original code below. NOTE! Showing 2 img line elements only to save space.

    Original code snippet below:

    ```html
            <section class="album_container">
                <h1> Social Celebrations</h1>
                <div class="album_photo_container">
                    <div class="image">
                        <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_01-pexels-any-lane-5727978.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="mom and daughter decorating a sponge cake with chocolate">
                        <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_02-pexels-august-de-richelieu-4262422.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="family of 5 standing and looking down to a strawberry cake placed on the table">
                                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>
    ```

    Original CSS code:

    ```css
    .album_container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(6,1fr);
        grid-auto-rows: 100px 300px;
        grid-gap: 10px;
    }

    .album_photo_container {
        width: 100%;
        Height: 100%;
        position: relative;
    }

    .album_photo_container .image {
        width: 100%;
        Height: 100%;
        overflow: hidden;
    }

    .album_photo_container .image img {
        width: 100%;
        Height: 100%;
        object-fit: cover;
    ```

    Solution: To fix the issue had to place each image in it's own div wrapper and have same class applied to all images.


    Fixed code snippet below:

    ```html
      <section class="album_container"> <!--container-->
             <div class="album_photo_container"> <!--gallery_container-->
                <div class="album_item"> <!--gallery_item-->
                    <div class="image"> <!--image-->
                        <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_01-pexels-any-lane-5727978.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="mom and daughter decorating a sponge cake with chocolate" >
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="album_photo_container">
                <div class="album_item">
                    <div class="image">        
                        <img src="/assets/images/gallery/SC_02-pexels-august-de-richelieu-4262422.jpg" class="album_photo" alt="family of 5 standing and looking down to a strawberry cake placed on the table">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

    ```


3. BIG ISSUE reported to CI.

    Found and issue with @media queries, set breakpoints did not apply/function i.e 768px to i.e 420px in Chrome dev tools.
    
    @media queries were being applied correctly when not using the tool but instead resizing the browser page.

    Code Institute Support confirmed the bug and requested to inform assessor that dev tools to check responsiveness should not be used, instead resize the browser window.
    
     CSS Rules below:
    ```css

    @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
        .album_container {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        }
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
        .album_container {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(1fr, 1fr);
        }
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 420px) {
        .album_container {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(1fr);
        }
    }
    ```

    Results differ when using dev tools and resizing the browser.
